# Pypi Package

## Introduction

### Build a Python package and upload the package to PyPi

In this project, a new python package will be created and published on Pypi for public use. 

This python package is initailly intended to calculate Newton"s method and maybe other features would be added to it in the future.
there are several ideas described belwo to make this project outstanding. 

## Description of Project:

- create a package that does basic matrix algebra such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, matrix inversion, etc.
- make a calculus package that implements algorithms such as Newton's method
- create a package built on top of Matplotlib or Seaborn that creates well-formatted, well labeled visualizations
- create an object-oriented package to play a game of tic-tac-toe between two human players.
- or make a number guessing game where the computer randomly chooses an integer and then tells a human player if a guess is higher or lower than the number

your package should be placed in a folder with the following folders and files:

the Python code that makes up your package
a **README.md** file
an **__init__.py**
**license.txt**
**setup.cfg**

## Motivation:
The aim of the project is to learn how to build a package using object oriented programming with python and then how to upload it on **Pypi**. There are several techniques which can be learned performing this project. 

## Acknowledgement

Thanks for **Udacity** for giving this opportunity to work on this project in the process of learning and becoming data scientist. There are several techniques can be learned doing this project which are realted to software development. 
this project is public and can be contributed with anybody interested in data science.

Thanks
